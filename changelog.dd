$(BUGSTITLE Compiler Changes,

$(LI $(LNAME2 objective-c-support, Basic support for Objective-C.)

    $(P Basic support for Objective-C classes, interfaces and instance methods.
        This is implemented by adding a new linkage attribute, Objective-C, and
        a compiler recognized UDA, @selector. The linkage attribute is to be
        used on a class or interface. The UDA is attached to a method.

$(LI $(LNAME2 property-switch-deprecated, The $(TT -property) switch has
    been deprecated.)

    $(P The $(TT -property) switch used to disallow calling non-properties
        without parentheses. The switch has not been used to build Phobos for
        some time now. So naturally, code that's incompatible with
        $(TT -property) has found its way in. This means, the switch has
        effectively not been supported by D at large.
    )

    $(P Since the behaviour of the $(TT -property) switch was not well-liked,
        it's been deprecated and made to have no effect when used.
